       "  ' The art and animation are pretty good, despite being made in the 9Os . The show just has this timeless intensely visually cartoony atmosphere and style to it . Despite including the dreaded abomination that is CGI, the show manages to make very good use of it in the scenes that include it . The original soundtrack is pretty good overall . The OST by Takanori Arisawa of Sailor Moon fame is fine for the most part, but where the show’s soundtrack really shines is in the opening themes . The dub & sub are both fairly good, but I prefer the dub over the sub for nostalgic reasons, despite the fact it cuts some of the more serious parts of the show .',\n",
       "  \" [ANIME_NAME] has cool characters, adventure, big monster fights, and a very interesting world . It was one of the first anime I watched as a kid, and it will always be one of my all time favorites . It's recommended that you go for the sub if you want to see the slightly more serious original version . On the other hand, consider looking towards the more mature Digimon Tamers, written by Chiaki J. Konaka, the writer of Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze and Ghost Hound .\"],\n",
       " [\" The story is almost like Lost (the famous american drama about a group of people stuck on a deserted island) in the way the poor protagonists deal with being stuck in the Digi-world . It's hard to rate this since it's a kids show that I watched together with my daughter and did not watch it when I was a kid, thus no emotional attachment to it . If you've got kids of your own, this is not exchangeable with Pokemon, it is lots of scary stuff going on and for my daughter, she was too young for it . So we'll be having a Sailor Moon marathon instead .\"],\n",
       " [\" The opening and English soundtrack has got to be one of the most grating things I've ever heard in an anime . The English script for this show was a little painful, riddled with bad puns that made me cringe more often than laugh . The character designs were simple, the backgrounds pastel blurs... And then there were a few dub-only problems... Some may not think it fair to include them, but as I watched this show (and continue to rewatch this show) in English, these problems can't be ignored when I go to sum up my view of this show .\"],\n",
       " [' One of the Anime always horribly overrated due to nostalgia . The episodes are not only episodic, but highly repetitive . The entire \"story\" (if you even want to call it this) is pretty much: \"We get in the digital world. Some villains do appear. We need to fight. Hurray, Deus Ex Ex Machina saves the day\"',\n",
       "  ' The characters are just horrible stereotypes with mostly not one single bit of originality to it . Only two exceptions would be [CHAR], who is a classy hero, but at least has some decent character development . The animation is horrible, even by the standards of 1999 . The soundtrack is quite nice, but cannot make up for the series overall problems when it comes to story and characters . If this series would have not been the first Digimon series to air, I am quite sure, it would be well hated within the fandom .'],\n",
       " [\" The anime has a good adventure, but the construction of the script is kind of lazy and a bit sloppy . Each main character has a different personality, as do his digimons as well, making a good interaction between them from the beginning of the anime to the end . The anime action scenes are good overall, but some end up too fast and others are pretty repetitive . Overall, Digimon is simple, but it's fun after all .\",\n",
       "  ' Aventura em dois worlds diferente, boa interação entre personagens (humanos e digimons) trilha sonora marcante, bom uso dos vilões na trama e as digievolutions (é lógico!!) Apesar do anime ter uma boa aventura, a construção do roteiro is meio preguiçosa e um pouco desleixada .'],\n",
       " [' The story tell you the bond between the digimons and the choosen children, and their friendship . The 8 choosen (7 in beginning and 1 join later) children called by someone mysterious to save the digital world from digimon whom seek for destruction . Character development in the character . Enjoyment : 8 From my point of view back then when i was child. i so enjoyed this series. So not long ago i tried again to rewatch . Though there are many people said that this is just for kid, but sometimes adult enjoyed this show too .'],\n",
       " [' Story is amazing, about a few kids who go to a summer camp, then get teleported to a digital world . But it\\'s slightly predictable because a villain will come up and fight them . But the best part about that is that there are several twists,(a new villain, new stage, drawback) which makes it amazing and brings a chill down your spine . Art 10/10 I love that \"old\" style of art, it reminds me when i was a little girl . The fights and transformation scenes are awesome . Overall, i really enjoyed this anime .'],\n",
       " [\" When I was little, around six or so years old, I came across a commercial that looked like Pokemon...but it wasn't . Some time later, I found it on TV and became immersed by it . Recently, thanks to my Digimon high, I managed to find, and watch, all the Japanese episodes with English subtitles, and I finished it! The story's rather simple. During summer camp, seven young kids get swept into this new world called the Digital World . There, they each receive a Digimon partner who either matches or is opposite their personality . They go through various adventures as they have to save both their world and their world from various dastardly villains .\",\n",
       "  ' Despite the animation\\'s slight flaws, it did grab my attention when I was little, and it sure branded itself into my memory . The music...honestly, I don\\'t remember the soundtracks for either the Japanese or English versions at all . The English version used it\\'s cheesy \"Hey Digimon\" insert song, which I remember very well as it used to be one of my favorites . I loved Brave Heart, though I have to admit, I wish they didn\\'t use it for every single episode . This seems to be a thing in all Digimon shows . Digimon Xros Wars, the most recent season, happens to be the worst case as it uses many different insert songs in ONE episode alone .',\n",
       "  \" The characters, while a bit cliched, are charming in a way . I didn't really like either ending songs for the Japanese versions of this though . I feel that the English dub did a better job at casting and giving fitting voices to the characters than the Japanese . Some of the voices in Japanese really made my ears bleed, like [CHAR], [CHAR] (and Angemon! The Japanese made him sound like a little boy! Thank God the English version gave him a manlier voice!), Palmon, [CHAR], and [CHAR]!\",\n",
       "  \" Digimon portrays children and their struggles almost perfectly . It's a kid show, but it doesn't talk down to it's audience . It doesn't shy away from dark themes and subjects . While it's not Pokemon, Digimon is it's own entity, and a great one at that, and it will always have a place in my heart next to Pokemon . Now if only someone will re-release this and all the other seasons on DVD, it's a shame how low the franchise has gone nowadays (Digimon Hunters)\"],\n",
       " [\" The anime chronicles the adventures of a group of kids from summer camp who befriended a select group of monsters called Digimon . The success and popularity of the anime as well as it's longevity makes the series being regarded as one of the best animes of all time . The team consists of eight kids and their Digimon Partners .\"],\n",
       " [' The original idea behind this show was \"12 episodes, quick marketing with toys\" which quickly digi-volved into a grand 57 Episode series . The part that made this so great, was the characters. with the 7(eventualy 8) Protaganists, it\\'s hard to not relate to at least one of them . The initial characters look like your basic Stereotypes, from the Cool kid, Nerd, Tomboy, Valley Girl, and Glasses guy, quickly evolves into a host of relatable characters and we realize why stereotypes exist . Adding the parents into the lives of the children was possibly he greatest thing!',\n",
       "  \" The Parents in Digimon are more than fixtures to move the plot, from the divorced couple, to the perfect parents, and the loving, yet secretive, secretive parents . Villans have neat designs and very shallow reasons...but this show is intended for young children . The Action is standard, PUNCH, KICK, Special Attack, DODGE! Overall, the plot isn't the focus, the Writing is, and thats where the draw lies .\",\n",
       "  \" The difference between the Real and Digital world is Dramatic simply from a Color Swap, from Bright to a Dull, mood changing tone . It's for Kids, Kids will love it, and once you've seen it, you'll know why I still remember those amazing moments 11 Years later as I rewatch just to catch them agian . The Key Dramatic moments that even the Horrible people who hacked the Show to Censored English Bits knew they couldn't remove, is how much impact they leave . If I showed you just those Scenes you'd know how much of an impact this show can have, and we have plenty of them!\"],\n",
       " [\" Finnish dubs are the best I've ever heard . Story is really great, but not in the start . Art is really good for anime that was created 14 years ago . Personal favorite characters are [CHAR], [CHAR], Koshiro and [CHAR] (somehow) I've rewatch'd it and even though I'm 18 years old now I still enjoy'd it really much .\"],\n",
       " [' When I was really little, I fell in love with the show but I didn’t know how chopped up the English dub was . I liked that they put more depth into the characters and the story lines made sure you could see the characters grow . Unfortunately, as with all shows that have way too many characters in the spotlight, we end up seeing more of one character then the others .',\n",
       "  ' Out of all the characters, I have to say my favorite is [CHAR] . I would have loved to see more of the characters backgrounds rather then little bits of three or four characters . The bad guys are very one dimensional . I wish they could have added a bit more to them but at least they each have a type of personality . The English voices are pretty good and bounce off each other nicely .'],\n",
       " [' This is a perfect example of a classic, something that still blows your mind even after years of not seeing it . I liked almost everything about this anime and the \"cyberpunk\" story of it . The story was very heartfelt and the characters were very realistic . The last episodes 36 up until the last episodes are some of the most entertaining moments of any media I\\'ve ever witness .'],\n",
       " [\" The ending is both happy and very sad (at this point I always seemed to cry T_T) The show gives a string of moral lessons, and gives the children a purpose they seemed to lack before . The children have by then become very mature, but still less to make them recognizable as children after all . The second and later arcs represent the main struggle, and the show becomes even more appealing, to the point that you can't leave it anymore . The character development also take place during this arc, along with that touch of emotional feel . Afterwards the Vandemon arc puts an end to the many dissatisfactions affecting the children among themselves and their loved ones, finally creating a formidable team before the last arc .\",\n",
       "  ' Storywise I think it was almost perfect in that it did marvellously well for its demographic group . Art is surprisingly brilliant for 1999, with a harmonious blend of computer-made graphics and hand-drawn cartoons, excepting a few micro-flaws that is. 9/10 The soundtrack was my most favourite part (and by that I mean the subbed version) as it keeps you on track and glued to the show. 10/10 As for enjoyment the show is very good in this regard and has a tendency to keep people glued to it till the end. As mentioned before character development is very prominent in the series and the characters themselves leave a profound impact on the viewer .'],\n",
       " [\" The depth of each and every character is so great that it really sucks you in . The lead character [CHAR] Yagami starts to get interesting only at about Episode 20 . Allmost all of the other chacters have a destinct history and you want them to go through that struggle and come out victorious . They're likable, deep, well designed, funny, dramatic, enjoyable .\",\n",
       "  \" The animation style shows, it's still an experimental series in a way, that the following series got a way higher budget and so forth have a better more elaborate animation . The most ingenious move was to take the japanese music with the english names of digimon and people . The villains on the other hand are pretty basic. They are destinct and some of them are really funny but still there is not much of a quality behind being evil . But this is the compromise you make, because this series isn't about the villains. The stage belongs to the main characters.\",\n",
       "  \" The songs are legendary. I remember even as a child I was singing the opening whenever the series was on. And now as an adult it hasn't changed one bit. Some of the insert songs can be a little sentimental but over all it was very good music. To sum it up, digimon is not only a great series. It's an experience which brings you deeper than any other series of that content before. With this we had more memorable names and the unbelievable music of the japanese original. If you haven't heard any of it check it out. You won't be disappointed.\"],\n",

I remember seeing it when i was only a 7~8y in the living room screaming for [CHAR] and company to beat the \"digibaddiels\" up . After 18 years i started rewatching it for the MAL anime challenge, and OH BOY IM GLAD I DID. It is fun, has a lot of memorable moments . Im no anime expert, but i surely recommend this, it\\'ll surely make you entertained the entire rid']]"
